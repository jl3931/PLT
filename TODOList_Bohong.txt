X 4. Not sure about the function of "HIDETURTLE" and "SHOWTURTLE".
Actrally, it's finished already.
If you use eclipse, please make sure that logo_turtle.png
is under project folder, not src or bin.
If this still doesn't work, make copies under src and bin folder.

TODO List:
4. Not sure about the function of "HIDETURTLE" and "SHOWTURTLE".

-----

TODO List:
X 1. moved: command moved to Jiao’s list (by Kam)

X 2. removed: replicate of Jiao’s list

X 3. A new problem. Input:  Set i 1. 
	It works well, despite on the console, eclipse reports error: Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: bad position: 10

Same when we input: FD 100.

X 4. Not sure about the function of "HIDETURTLE" and "SHOWTURTLE".

X 5. ERROR WITH "[FD 100]". I suppose maybe we can do this.


Resolved 6. Error with if (( 1 <  2 )) [FD 100], but not if ( 1 <  2 ) [FD 100]

	I think maybe we need to implement parentheses.
	The following one does not function, either.
	if ((1<2 && 2 < 3) || 1>2) [FD 100]
	
	I see Jiao's comment on this, "This is because somehow it parses (1<2) as expression list instead of
using rule expr->(expr)". I wonder are we going to fix this?

Added unary_not ‘!’ 7. When dealing with the logic calculation, do we have "not"? like ~(1>2) or !(1>2), I see we have "!="
